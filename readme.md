# Movie-Analysis-Mod1
By: Jagandeep Singh & Eryk Wdowiak

## Introduction
For this project we explored the movie Industry. We had data for over 2000+
movies. This data title, included budget, domestic_gross, worldwide_gross, rating,
crew, genres etc. But all these values were in different datasets. For analysis
and visualization, we used Pandas, numpy, Matplotlib and seaborn.

## Project Goals
Our goal in this project is to answer the following questions using the data
provided.
1. An Overview of Movie profitability
2. What is the relationship between:
     -a Movieâ€™s Production Budget and its Profitability
     -the Month of Release and Profitability
     -Genres and Profitability
     -Ratings and Profitability

## Data Cleaning
After loading all the data files, our first step was to clean the data.
Since the data was lay out over multiple files, our first task was to merge the
useful data in one pandas dataframe. We went through all of the given data files
to clean the data and merge it appropriately. Our goal in data cleaning was to
get everything we need in one place to make it easy for our exploratory data
analysis.

## Data Analysis and Visualization
Our first goal was an overview of movie profitability. We looked at the log of
production budget and worldwide_gross, then we calculated log of profit for each
movie. Then a histogram was plotted for log of profit.
